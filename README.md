# Huffman-coding
Huffman coding is a lossless data compression algorithm.
In this algorithm, a variable-length code is assigned to input different characters. 
The code length is related to how frequently characters are used. Most frequent characters have the smallest codes and longer codes for least frequent characters.
simply we use any java intellij for executing the code.
we must have to save the file with main class name such as: HuffmanAlgorithm.java
in this program we have no need of given any input we already given a character array and also their frequencies.
we can also give a input string then we have to find unique characters and also their frequencies.
